The Test Cases are as follows:
1. Test successful login with valid credentials - Here I have provided the valid credentials to check whether i am able to login or not.
2. Test unsuccessful login attempts with invalid credentials - Here I provided worng credentials to ensure that i cant login.
3. Validate that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid login attempts - Here i am checking after trying to log in with invalid credentials does the warnimg message pop ups or not.
4. On successful login, validate that the user is redirected to the dashboard screen - Here i am checking whether i am getting redirected to the dashboard after successfully logging in.


The challenges I faced while during the testing is that i was having difficulties in running the tests in 2 browsers simultaneously but i did some research on the internet found the solution by using 'testcafe "chrome,firefox" tests/login.js'.
